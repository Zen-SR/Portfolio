Hello! 

I'm Zenon, a Senior Data Analyst from London (UK) currently based in Melbourne. 

I'm interested in automating various aspects of my life and playing with coding ideas I've had before.
I'm currently learning Python, possibly learning R in the future, and I'm happy to collaborate on projects or hear your feedback on my code.

Feel free to reach out to me via email at: Zenonsasiakrushby@hotmail.com
